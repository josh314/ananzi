Asynchronous web crawler. For Python 3.4 or more recent, since it relies on the standard library `asyncio` module (if unfamiliar, [see the docs](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html)). Also uses the asynchronous HTTP client functionality in the third-party module `aiohttp`. The `aiohttp`[github page](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html) has a crawler in their example code from which I got a bit of guidance for this project.
